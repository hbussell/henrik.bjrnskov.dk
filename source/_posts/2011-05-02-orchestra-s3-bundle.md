title: 'Orchestra, S3, Bundle and Monolog'
---

A few weeks ago i helped [Orchestra][orchestra] with writing documentation on getting started with
[Symfony2][symfony] on their service.

This resulted in [David Coallier][david] starting a [OrchestraS3StreamBundle][bundle] for use
with [Monolog][monolog] and enabling other file operations to use s3 adding support
for [Services\_Amazon\_S3][pear].

The main work on this bundle was done by [David Coallier][david] with support
by [Lukas Smith][lukas] and myself. So you should check it out and see if it can be of any use
for you in your projects.
