What is RPX? Well this is from their website:

    RPX allows users to sign-in with a single click using an account they already have.
    This eliminates the need for registration forms and simplifies and accelerates the
    login process.

Which for me sounds terricfic since i would hate to roll my own openId, Facebook Connect,
OAuth signin solutions when i get it all served on a silver platter.
So here is a simple PHP wrapper class for their service.

It's not much yet, but overtime when i get the need for it, ill implement the other method calls or
YOU could implement and send a pull request. And for all of thoose saying there already is a class
for this, yes there is but the code kinda sucked and didnt follow my standard implementations.

Check out http://postmarkapp.com and http://transload. It os two services that blows my mind and i
can't wait to get some time and play with thoose. Stay tuned for a `Swift_Transport_Postmark`
dropin class.
