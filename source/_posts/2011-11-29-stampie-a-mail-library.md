Please welcome [Stampie](http://github.com/henrikbjorn/Stampie) on the block. It is a small library
i created for using [Postmark](http://postmarkapp.com) for my Symfony application.

There is nothing much to say about it other than it Supports Postmark and [SendGrid](http://sendgrid.com)
together with [Guzzle](http://guzzlephp.org) and [Buzz](http://github.com/kriswallsmith/Buzz) as the backend
client.

The readme page says it all about how to use it. And if you find any bugs, please report them and/or
do a Pull Request (They are awesome!) otherwise you are welcome to leave a comment.

### Why did i create my own?

Becuse all the others out there just **SUCKS** (Steve Jobs said it and so can i!)
